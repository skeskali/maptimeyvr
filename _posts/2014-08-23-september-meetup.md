We have a date! We have space!

**Date**: Tuesday, September 9, 2014

**Time**: 6:30 - 8:00pm

**Location**: BC Libraries Cooperative, 605 Robson Street, Suite 850

Help us get @maptimeVAN off to a great start! The agenda is up to you, but I thought it would be good to start off with some basic info: how often do we want to meet (weekly or monthly), intros, and an overview of all the fun geo/mappy stuff happening in Vancouver. If there’s time, I (Cecily) will do a presentation on OpenStreetMap 101.
